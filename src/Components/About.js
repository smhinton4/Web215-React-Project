<p>
    Hello, I'm Sierra Hinton. I enjoy all things creative from sketching, writing, and painting to using my creative abilities to design webpages.
    As a web development student, I have learned a great deal about creating functional, responsive websites that are accessibile to all. As I continue to learn, I'll also be building my knowledge and obtaining skills along the way.
